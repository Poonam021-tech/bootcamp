                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Peafowl is a common name for two bird species of the genus <em>Pavo</em>and one species of the
                    closely related genus Afropavo within the tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae (the pheasants
                    and their allies). Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as
                    peahens.

                    The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the Indian subcontinent, and
                    the green peafowl from Southeast Asia. The third peafowl species, the Congo peafowl, is native only
                    to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage.
                    The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or
                    "train" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual.

                    The functions of the elaborate iridescent coloration and large "train" of peacocks have been the
                    subject of extensive scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they served to attract
                    females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual selection. More recently, Amotz
                    Zahavi proposed in his handicap principle that these features acted as honest signals of the males'
                    fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large
                    and conspicuous structures.</p>

            <section id="evolution">
                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <p>Sexual selection
                    Charles Darwin suggested in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex that peafowl plumage
                    may have evolved through sexual selection:

                    Many female progenitors of the peacock must, during a long line of descent, have appreciated this
                    superiority; for they have unconsciously, by the continued preference for the most beautiful males,
                    rendered the peacock the most splendid of living birds.

                    Aposematism and natural selection
                    It has been suggested that a peacock's train, loud call, and fearless behavior have been formed by
                    natural selection (with or without sexual selection too), and served as an aposematic display to
                    intimidate predators and rivals.[8][9] This hypothesis is designed to explain Takahashi's
                    observations that in Japan, neither reproductive success nor physical condition correlate with the
                    train's length, symmetry or number of eyespots.[10]

                    Female choice
                    See also: Mate choice

                    Peacock (seen from behind) displaying to attract peahen in foreground
                    Multiple hypotheses involving female choice have been posited. One hypothesis is that females choose
                    mates with good genes. Males with more exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, such as bigger,
                    brighter peacock trains, tend to have better genes[example needed] in the peahen's eyes.[11] These
                    better genes directly benefit her offspring, as well as her fitness and reproductive success.

                    Runaway selection is another hypothesis. In runaway sexual selection, linked genes in males and
                    females code for sexually dimorphic traits in males, and preference for those traits in females.[12]
                    The close spatial association of alleles[which?] for loci[which?] involved in the train in males,
                    and for preference for more exuberant trains in females, on the chromosome (linkage disequilibrium)
                    causes a positive feedback loop that exaggerates both the male traits and the female preferences.

                    Another hypothesis is sensory bias, in which females have a preference for a trait in a non-mating
                    context that becomes transferred to mating, such as Merle Jacobs' food-courtship hypothesis, which
                    suggests that peahens are attracted to peacocks for the resemblance of their eye spots to blue
                    berries.[13]

                    Multiple causalities for the evolution of female choice are also possible.

                    The peacock's train and iridescent plumage are perhaps the best-known examples of traits believed to
                    have arisen through sexual selection, though with some controversy.[14] Male peafowl erect their
                    trains to form a shimmering fan in their display for females. Marion Petrie tested whether or not
                    these displays signalled a male's genetic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in
                    Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England. The number of eyespots in the train predicted a male's
                    mating success. She was able to manipulate this success by cutting the eyespots off some of the
                    males' tails:[15] females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones.
                    Males with fewer eyespots, thus having lower mating success, suffered from greater predation.[16]
                    She allowed females to mate with males with differing numbers of eyespots, and reared the offspring
                    in a communal incubator to control for differences in maternal care. Chicks fathered by more
                    ornamented males weighed more than those fathered by less ornamented males, an attribute generally
                    associated with better survival rate in birds. These chicks were released into the park and
                    recaptured one year later. Those with heavily ornamented feathers were better able to avoid
                    predators and survive in natural conditions.[17] Thus, Petrie's work shows correlations between tail
                    ornamentation, mating success, and increased survival ability in both the ornamented males and their
                    offspring.


                    A peacock in flight: Zahavi argued that the long train would be a handicap.
                    Furthermore, peafowl and their sexual characteristics have been used in the discussion of the causes
                    for sexual traits. Amotz Zahavi used the excessive tail plumes of male peafowls as evidence for his
                    "handicap principle".[18] Since these trains are likely to be deleterious to an individual's
                    survival (as their brilliance makes them more visible to predators and their length hinders escape
                    from danger), Zahavi argued that only the fittest males could survive the handicap of a large train.
                    Thus, a brilliant train serves as an honest indicator for females that these highly ornamented males
                    are good at surviving for other reasons, so are preferable mates.[19] This theory may be contrasted
                    with Ronald Fisher's hypothesis that male sexual traits are the result of initially arbitrary
                    aesthetic selection by females.

                    In contrast to Petrie's findings, a seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl concluded that
                    female peafowl do not select mates solely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no
                    evidence that peahens preferred peacocks with more elaborate trains (such as with more eyespots), a
                    more symmetrical arrangement, or a greater length.[10] Takahashi determined that the peacock's train
                    was not the universal target of female mate choice, showed little variance across male populations,
                    and did not correlate with male physiological condition. Adeline Loyau and her colleagues responded
                    that alternative and possibly central explanations for these results had been overlooked.[20] They
                    concluded that female choice might indeed vary in different ecological conditions.

                    Plumage colours as attractants

                    Eyespot on a peacock's train feather
                    A peacock's copulation success rate depends on the colours of his eyespots (ocelli) and the angle at
                    which they are displayed. The angle at which the ocelli are displayed during courtship is more
                    important in a peahen's choice of males than train size or number of ocelli.[21] Peahens pay careful
                    attention to the different parts of a peacock's train during his display. The lower train is usually
                    evaluated during close-up courtship, while the upper train is more of a long-distance attraction
                    signal. Actions such as train rattling and wing shaking also kept the peahens' attention.[22]

                    Redundant signal hypothesis
                    Although an intricate display catches a peahen's attention, the redundant signal hypothesis also
                    plays a crucial role in keeping this attention on the peacock's display. The redundant signal
                    hypothesis explains that whilst each signal that a male projects is about the same quality, the
                    addition of multiple signals enhances the reliability of that mate. This idea also suggests that the
                    success of multiple signalling is not only due to the repetitiveness of the signal, but also of
                    multiple receivers of the signal. In the peacock species, males congregate a communal display during
                    breeding season and the peahens observe. Peacocks first defend their territory through intra-sexual
                    behaviour, defending their areas from intruders. They fight for areas within the congregation to
                    display a strong front for the peahens. Central positions are usually taken by older, dominant
                    males, which influences mating success. Certain morphological and behavioural traits come in to play
                    during inter and intra-sexual selection, which include train length for territory acquisition and
                    visual and vocal displays involved in mate choice by peahens.[23]</p>

                <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                <p>Peafowl are forest birds that nest on the ground, but roost in trees. They are terrestrial feeders.
                    All species of peafowl are believed to be polygamous. In common with other members of the
                    Galliformes, the males possess metatarsal spurs or "thorns" on their legs used during intraspecific
                    territorial fights with some other members of their kind.

                    In courtship, vocalisation stands to be a primary way for peacocks to attract peahens. Some studies
                    suggest that the intricacy of the "song" produced by displaying peacocks proved to be impressive to
                    peafowl. Singing in peacocks usually occurs just before, just after, or sometimes during
                    copulation.[24]</p>

            <section id="diet">
                <h2>Diet</h2>
                <p>Peafowl are omnivores and mostly eat plants, flower petals, seed heads, insects and other arthropods,
                    reptiles, and amphibians. Wild peafowl look for their food scratching around in leaf litter either
                    early in the morning or at dusk. They retreat to the shade and security of the woods for the hottest
                    portion of the day. These birds are not picky and will eat almost anything they can fit in their
                    beak and digest. They actively hunt insects like ants, crickets and termites; millipedes; and other
                    arthropods and small mammals.[25] Indian peafowl also eat small snakes.[26]

                    Domesticated peafowl may also eat bread and cracked grain such as oats and corn, cheese, cooked rice
                    and sometimes cat food. It has been noticed by keepers that peafowl enjoy protein-rich food
                    including larvae that infest granaries, different kinds of meat and fruit, as well as vegetables
                    including dark leafy greens, broccoli, carrots, beans, beets, and peas.[27]</p>

                <h2>Cultural significance</h2>
                <p>Indian peafowl

                    The Hindu god Kartikeya with his wives on his peacock mount
                    The peafowl is native to India[28] and significant in its culture.[29] In Hinduism, the Indian
                    peacock is the mount of the god of war, Kartikeya, and the warrior goddess Kaumari, and is also
                    depicted around the goddess Santoshi.[30] During a war with Asuras, Kartikeya split the demon king
                    Surapadman in half. Out of respect for his adversary's prowess in battle, the god converted the two
                    halves into an integral part of himself. One half became a peacock serving as his mount, and the
                    other a rooster adorning his flag. The peacock displays the divine shape of Omkara when it spreads
                    its magnificent plumes into a full-blown circular form.[31] In the Tantric traditions of Hinduism
                    the goddess Tvarita is depicted with peacock feathers.[32] A peacock feather also adorns the crest
                    of the god Krishna.[33]

                    Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan Empire, was born an orphan and raised by a family
                    farming peacocks. According to the Buddhist tradition[which?], the ancestors of the Maurya kings had
                    settled in a region where peacocks (mora in Pali) were abundant. Therefore, they came to be known as
                    "Moriyas", literally, "belonging to the place of peacocks". According to another Buddhist account,
                    these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara ("Moriya-city"), which was so called, because it
                    was built with the "bricks coloured like peacocks' necks".[34] After conquering the Nanda Empire and
                    defeating the Seleucid Empire, the Chandragupta dynasty reigned uncontested during its time. Its
                    royal emblem remained the peacock until Emperor Ashoka changed it to a lion, as seen in the Lion
                    Capital of Ashoka, as well in his edicts. The peacock continued to represent elegance and royalty in
                    India during medieval times; for instance, the Mughal seat of power was called the Peacock Throne.

                    The peacock is represented in both the Burmese and Sinhalese zodiacs. To the Sinhalese people, the
                    peacock is the third animal of the zodiac of Sri Lanka.[35]

                    Peacocks (often a symbol of pride and vanity) were believed[by whom?] to deliberately consume
                    poisonous substances in order to become immune to them, as well as to make the colours of their
                    resplendent plumage all the more vibrant – seeing as so many poisonous flora and fauna are so
                    colourful due to aposematism, this idea appears to have merit. The Buddhist deity Mahamayuri is
                    depicted seated on a peacock. Peacocks are seen supporting the throne of Amitabha, the ruby red
                    sunset coloured archetypal Buddha of Infinite Light.

                    India adopted the peacock as its national bird in 1963 and it is one of the national symbols of
                    India.[36]

                    Middle East
                    Yazidism
                    Tawûsî Melek (lit. 'Peacock Angel')[37][38][39][40] one of the central figures of the Yazidi
                    religion, is symbolized with a peacock.[41][37] In Yazidi creation stories, before the creation of
                    this world, God created seven Divine Beings, of whom Tawûsî Melek was appointed as the leader. God
                    assigned all of the world's affairs to these seven Divine Beings, also often referred to as the
                    Seven Angels or heft sirr ("the Seven Mysteries").[41][42][43][44]

                    In Yazidism, the peacock is believed to represent the diversity of the world,[45] and the
                    colourfulness of the peacock's feathers is considered to represent of all the colours of nature. The
                    feathers of the peacock also symbolize sun rays, from which come light, luminosity and brightness.
                    The peacock opening the feathers of its tail in a circular shape symbolizes the sunrise.[46]

                    Consequently, due to its holiness, Yazidis are not allowed to hunt and eat the peacock, ill-treat it
                    or utter bad words about it. Images of the peacock are also found drawn around the sanctuary of
                    Lalish and on other Yazidi shrines and holy sites, homes, as well as religious, social, cultural and
                    academic centres.[46]

                    Mandaeism
                    In The Baptism of Hibil Ziwa, the Mandaean uthra and emanation Yushamin is described as a
                    peacock.[47]

                    Ancient Greece

                    A peacock walking freely around a zoo
                    Ancient Greeks believed that the flesh of peafowl did not decay after death,[citation needed] so it
                    became a symbol of immortality. In Hellenistic imagery, the Greek goddess Hera's chariot was pulled
                    by peacocks, birds not known to Greeks before the conquests of Alexander. Alexander's tutor,
                    Aristotle, refers to it as "the Persian bird". When Alexander saw the birds in India, he was so
                    amazed at their beauty that he threatened the severest penalties for any man who slew one.[48]
                    Claudius Aelianus writes that there were peacocks in India, larger than anywhere else.[49]

                    One myth states that Hera's servant, the hundred-eyed Argus Panoptes, was instructed to guard the
                    woman-turned-cow, Io. Hera had transformed Io into a cow after learning of Zeus's interest in her.
                    Zeus had the messenger of the gods, Hermes, kill Argus through eternal sleep and free Io. According
                    to Ovid, to commemorate her faithful watchman, Hera had the hundred eyes of Argus preserved forever,
                    in the peacock's tail.[50]

                    Christianity
                    The symbolism was adopted by early Christianity, thus many early Christian paintings and mosaics
                    show the peacock.[51] The peacock is still used in the Easter season, especially in the east. The
                    "eyes" in the peacock's tail feathers can symbolise the all-seeing Christian God,[52] the
                    Church,[53] or angelic wisdom.[54] The emblem of a pair of peacocks drinking from a vase is used as
                    a symbol of the eucharist and the resurrection, as it represents the Christian believer drinking
                    from the waters of eternal life.[55] The peacock can also symbolise the cosmos if one interprets its
                    tail with its many "eyes" as the vault of heaven dotted by the sun, moon, and stars.[56] Due to the
                    adoption by Augustine of the ancient idea that the peacock's flesh did not decay, the bird was again
                    associated with immortality.[53][55] In Christian iconography, two peacocks are often depicted
                    either side of the Tree of Life.[57]

                    The symbolic association of peacock feathers with the wings of angels led to the belief that the
                    waving of such liturgical fans resulted in an automated emission of prayers. This affinity between
                    peacocks' and angels' feathers was also expressed in other artistic media, including paintings of
                    angels with peacock feather wings [58]</p>
